# Richest Customer Wealth

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​` customer has in the `j​​​​​​​​​​​th`​​​​ bank. Return *the  **wealth**  that the richest customer has.* 

A customer's  **wealth**  is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum  **wealth**.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- m == accounts.length
- n == accounts[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- 1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100

                sum += accounts[i][j];
            }

        }

    }
}
