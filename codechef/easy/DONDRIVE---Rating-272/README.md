## Problem

### Donation Drive

A blood drive aims to collect $N$ number of blood donations.
The drive has collected $X$ donations so far. Find the remaining number of donations needed to reach the target.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $X$ — the number of required donations and the number of collected donations, respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, the remaining number of donations needed to reach the target.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 200$
- $1 \leq X \le N \leq 20$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
5 2
3 3
5 4
7 5

```

```
3
0
1
2

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The drive aims to collect $5$ donations and has collected $2$ already. Thus, they need to collect $3$ more donations to reach the target.

 **Test case $2$:**  The drive aims to collect $3$ donations and has collected $3$ already. Thus, they need to collect no more donations to reach the target.

 **Test case $3$:**  The drive aims to collect $5$ donations and has collected $4$ already. Thus, they need to collect $1$ more donation to reach the target.

 **Test case $4$:**  The drive aims to collect $7$ donations and has collected $5$ already. Thus, they need to collect $2$ more donations to reach the target.
