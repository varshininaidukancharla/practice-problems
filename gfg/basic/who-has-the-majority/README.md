## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  and two elements  **x**  and  **y**, return the element that occurs more frequently. If both elements have the same frequency, return the smaller one.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5], x = 4, y = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: frequency of 4 is 4.frequency of 5 is 1.Since 4>1 so return 4

```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], x = 1, y = 7
Output: 1
Explanation: frequency of 1 is 1.frequency of 7 is 1.Since 1 < 7, return 1.

```

```java
class Solution {
    public int moreFrequent(List<Integer> arr, int x, int y) {
        // code here
        int countx = 0;
        int county = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
            if (arr.get(i)==x){
                countx++;
            }
            if(arr.get(i)==y){
                county++;
            }
        }
        if(countx==county){
            if(x<y){
                return x;
            }
            else{
                return y;
            }
        }
        else if(countx>county){
            return x;
        }
        else{
            return y;
        }
    }
}
```
