# Size of Binary Tree

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, return the size of the tree. The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes in the tree.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input:      

Output:  3
Explanation: There are 3 nodes in the given binary tree, so its size is 3.
```

```
Input:

Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 nodes in the given binary tree, so its size is 6.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 105

```java
/*
Definition for Node
class Node
{
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    Node(int data)
    {
        this.data = data;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }
}
*/
class Solution {
    public int getSize(Node root) {
        // code here
        if(root == null) return 0;
        else{ 
            return 1+getSize(root.left)+getSize(root.right);
        }
    }
}
```
