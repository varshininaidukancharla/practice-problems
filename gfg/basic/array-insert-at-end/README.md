![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr**  that is not completely filled and a value  **val**, you have to insert the value at the  **end**  of the array.

**Examples :
**

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], val = 90
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 90]
Explanation: After inserting 90 at the end, we have array elements as 1 2 3 4 5 90.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], val = 50
Output: [1, 2, 3, 50]
Explanation: After inserting 50 at the end, we have array elements as 1 2 3 50.

```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ element, arr[i] ≤ 106

    public void insertAtEnd(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int val) {
        // code here
        arr.add(arr.size(),val);
    }
}
```
