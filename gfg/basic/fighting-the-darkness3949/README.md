## Problem

Given an array **arr[]**  representing the size of candles which is reduced by 1 unit each day. The room is illuminated using all the present candles. Find the maximum number of days the room will stay illuminated (at least one candle having a size greater than 0)

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2] 
Output: 2
Explanation: The candle's length is reduced by 1 in first day. So, at the end of day 1: Sizes would be [0 0 1], So, at end of second day: Sizes would be [0 0 0]. This means the room was illuminated for 2 days.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 2, 1] 
Output: 4

```

    public int maxDays(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        int max = arr[0];
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]>max){
                max = arr[i];
            }
        }
        return max;
        
    }
