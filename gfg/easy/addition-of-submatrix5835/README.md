# Sum of Submatrix Elements

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a matrix  **arr[][]**  of size  **n * m**  and four integers  **x1**,  **y1**,  **x2**, and  **y2** representing the top-left and bottom-right corners of a submatrix (using 1-based indexing), find the sum of all elements in that submatrix.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[][] = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]], x1 = 3, y1 = 4, x2 = 4, y2 = 5
Output: 78
Explanation: Sum from cell starting at position (3, 4) (1-based indexing) and ending at (4, 5) is 78 (16 + 17 + 22 + 23).

```

```
Input: arr[][] = [[9, 8, 7], [4, 2, 1], [6, 5, 3]], x1 = 1, y1 = 2, x2 = 3, y2 = 3
Output: 26
Explanation: Sum from cell starting at position (1, 2) (1-based indexing) and ending at (3, 3) is 26.

```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 103
1 ≤ arr[i][j] ≤ 1000
1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n
1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m

```java
class Solution {
    public int subMatrixSum(int[][] arr, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        // code herex
        x1--;
        y1--;
        x2--;
        y2--;
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=x1;i<=x2;i++){
            for(int j=y1;j<=y2;j++){
                sum+=arr[i][j];
            }
        }
        return sum;
        
    }
}
```
