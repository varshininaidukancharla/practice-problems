## Problem

Given an array a **rr**  of only 0's and 1's. The array is **sorted**  in such a manner that all the 1's are placed first and then they are followed by all the 0's. Find the **count**  of all the 0's.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 0's in the given array.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 0's in the array.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 <= arr.size <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 1

    int countZeroes(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]==0){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
