![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array of positive integers  **arr[]**, return the second largest element from the array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return  **-1.** 

Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist.
```

 **Constraints:** 
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

```java
class Solution {
    public int getSecondLargest(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.length;
        int largest=-1;
        int slargest=-1;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]>largest){
                slargest=largest;
                largest=arr[i];
            }
            else if(arr[i]<largest && arr[i]>slargest){
                slargest = arr[i];
            }
        }
        return slargest;
    }
}
```
