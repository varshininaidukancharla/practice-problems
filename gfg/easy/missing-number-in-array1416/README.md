# Missing in Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array  **arr[]**  of size  **n - 1**  that contains **distinct integers** in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with  **one element missing**. Your task is to identify and return the  **missing element**.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Only 1 is present so the missing element is 2.

```

```java
class Solution {
    int missingNum(int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length + 1;

        long sum = 0;
        for(int num : arr) {
            sum += num;
        }

        long total = (long)n * (n + 1) / 2;

        return (int)(total - sum);
    }
}
```
