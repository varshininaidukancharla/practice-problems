![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given the  **head** of a linked list and an integer  **x**, delete the node at position x and return the updated head of the linked list.

 **Note** : Positions use 1-based indexing.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: x = 4,

Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5
Explanation: After deleting the node at the 4th position, the linked list is as

```

```
Input: x = 6,

Output: 2 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 99
Explanation: After deleting the node at 6th position, the linked list is as

```

/* Structure of Linked List Node
class Node
{
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int d)
    {
        this.data = d;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
*/
class Solution {
    Node deleteNode(Node head, int x) {
        // code here
        if(x==1){
            return head.next;
        }
        Node temp = head;
        for(int i=1;i<x-1;i++){
            temp= temp.next;
        }
        temp.next=temp.next.next;
        return head;
    }
}
